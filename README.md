## TRAVL App

This project is a tavel guide responsive app and was developed using React.\

It includes different parts which each of them will be explained.

## Navbar

In this section we have app title and app icon. the icon is extracted from font-awesome. also there are four buttons that each of them navigates to the different page. These buttons are "Home", "Services", "Products" and "Sign-Up". navigation has been done using "react-router-dom" library.\

When we go on mobile, buttons will disappear and will be replaced in a column shape in sidebar menu which has a symbol of hamburger button to click on.

## Hero Section

When the app compiles seccessfuly the first thing that a user sees is Hero Section. in this section we have a video that autoplayes in a loop and two buttons for signing up and watching trailer. also we have a title "Visit IRAN"

## Cards

For this section, we put five cards that each of them is a suggestion for amazing characteristics of Iran.each card has an image with a paragraph below. when you hover on the image, the scale of the image changes. also in

On the left down corner of images, we have a label that represents type of named places.\

when you click on cards, app navigates to a services page(/services).\

### When you go on mobile, because of the resonsivity of the app, Cards will rearrange in columns.

## Footer

For footer we designed a gray background with an input for subscribing to get newsletters.\

In addition there are four columns:

1. About Us
2. Contact Us
3. Videos
4. Social Media \

And in the end we have a division named footer-logo to put app's icon and app's social media addresses.
